    "## Tokenizing and \"Count Vectorizing\" Text\n",
    "#### In this notebook, I will process the text data to each movie, doing final cleaning of punctuation, making all words lowercase and spliting text into individual word \"tokens\" (N.B., for those who are text processing-savvy, this was done outside of Vectorizers in order to retain the '-', since curse words are represented in these reviews as s--t and f--k. The frequency with which curse words appear in reviews may be an important text feature for parents...).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The first vectorizer I will explore is Count Vectorizer. Count Vectorizer will take the simple frequency of words found in text associated with each movie and turn it into that movie's \"word vector.\" Movies with similar word vectors will be judged to be similar. To favor words that appear to be associated with movies in general and to reduce the dimensionality of our word vector space, I will run the word vectors through a process called Truncated SVD. Truncated SVD is a method designed to capture the most variance in our collected movie word vectors in the fewest dimensions possible by taking orthogonal components through our vector space, each of which is a combination of words. I will then analyze these components to see if I can derive some meaning for some of them (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once we get our text data into truncatedSVD format, we will then use cosine similarity to determine which movies are most similar to which other movies in our data set. We will then also incorporate non-text data to see how this improves our cosine similarity-based similarity matrix (see Notebook 7)."

Unfortunately, this recommender will not work without the cosine similarity matrix, which is prohibitively large to upload to GitHub. In order to generate this file, you can either run the notebooks in this repo in order, or recompile the matrix from the 15 pieces that I've generated and uploaded as simmat0, simmat1, ..., simmat14. You can do so by executing the function at the bottom of notebook 5.1."
