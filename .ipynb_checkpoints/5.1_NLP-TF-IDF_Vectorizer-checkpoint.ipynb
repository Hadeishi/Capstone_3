    "## Tokenizing and TF-IDF Vectorization:  Text-based Cosine Similarity\n",
    "#### In this notebook, I will process the text data to each movie, doing final cleaning of punctuation, making all words lowercase and spliting text into individual word \"tokens\" (N.B., for those who are text processing-savvy, this was done outside of Vectorizers in order to retain the '-', since curse words are represented in these reviews as s--t and f--k. The frequency with which these curse words appear in reviews may be an important text feature for parents).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The vectorizer I will use in this notebook is TF-IDF Vectorizer. TF-IDF Vectorizer will take the frequency of words that are found in text associated with each movie and divide by the frequency with which a term appears in all of the documents put together. This technique is designed to give greater weight to terms that occur frequently in a document but not in other documents, thus controlling for words that appear frequently in all movies--- such as the word, \"movie,\" for example. It will then turn the TF-IDF statistic into the movie's \"word vector.\" These word vectors will then be run through Truncated SVD as described in Notebook 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once we get our text data into truncatedSVD format, I will use cosine similarity to determine which movies are most similar to which other movies in our data set. We will then also incorporate non-text data to see how this improves our cosine similarity-based similarity matrix (see below)."
